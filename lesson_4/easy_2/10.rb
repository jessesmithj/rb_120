What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.


# OOP helps us organize code by using real world examples of tangible objects
   # This layer of abstraction can help us think more clearly about how to solve a problem 

# OOP allows programmers to work together in larger systems and only use the methods/objects 
# they need, which limits the scope of what they may have access to, minimizing errors 

# OOP limits dependencies in programming, so whereas you may need to make numerous changes 
# using procedural programming, you may only need to make a single update in a class/method/etc using OOP
